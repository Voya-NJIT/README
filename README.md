## Product Vision

### Far Vision
We want to transform the way groups of friends, families, and coworkers plan meetups by providing a **seamless, social-first platform** that finds a fair **midpoint location** and suggests activities and restaurants. Long-term, our goal is to make group outing planning as easy as one click — anywhere in the world.

### Near Vision
For the first iteration, our platform will:
- Allow users to **input multiple starting locations**.
- Calculate a **central meeting point** that minimizes travel time for everyone.
- Suggest **restaurants and activities** around the midpoint.
- Provide a way to **share the chosen meetup spot** with the group.

## Stakeholders
1. **Casual Friend Groups**  
   - Need: Find a fun, fair meetup spot for hangouts.  
   - Fulfilled: Our app suggests activities/restaurants that are convenient for all.  

2. **Families Living Apart**  
   - Need: Balance driving times between members who live far apart.  
   - Fulfilled: Midpoint algorithm ensures no one drives unfairly longer.  

3. **Coworkers / Small Teams**  
   - Need: Pick an accessible place for after-work or weekend outings.  
   - Fulfilled: Recommends neutral locations with group-friendly venues.

## Product Backlog
Our backlog is stored in **Voya Sprint**: https://github.com/orgs/Voya-NJIT/projects/1


### Example User Stories
1. As a user, I want to enter my starting location so the app can calculate a midpoint.  
2. As a user, I want to add my friends’ addresses so the app considers everyone’s travel distance.  
3. As a user, I want the app to calculate a fair midpoint so no one drives significantly more.  
4. As a user, I want to see restaurants near the midpoint so we have options to eat.  
5. As a user, I want to see fun activities near the midpoint so we can plan something besides food.  
6. As a user, I want to filter activities by type (e.g., coffee, casual dining, bowling, outdoor) so we can pick what we enjoy.  
7. As a user, I want to share the chosen midpoint and activity with my group so everyone knows where to go.  
8. As a user, I want to see estimated travel times for each participant so I know it’s fair.  
9. As a user, I want the interface to be simple so I can plan a meetup in under 2 minutes.  
10. As a user, I want the app to remember past midpoints so I can quickly repeat successful meetups.

## Backlog Ordering Rationale
- **MVP first:** Entering addresses, calculating midpoint, and seeing restaurants.  
- **Next priority:** Activities and filtering options.  
- **Later:** Sharing functionality and history of meetups.  
This ordering ensures users get immediate value from the first release while leaving room for growth.
