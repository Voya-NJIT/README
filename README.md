## Product Vision

### Far Vision
We want to transform the way groups of friends, families, and coworkers plan meetups by providing a **seamless, social-first platform** that finds a fair **midpoint location** and suggests activities and restaurants. Long-term, our goal is to make group outing planning as easy as one simple click.

### Near Vision
For the first iteration, our platform will:
- Allow users to **input multiple starting locations**.
- Calculate a **central meeting point** that minimizes travel time for everyone.
- Suggest **restaurants and activities** around the midpoint.
- Provide a way to **share the chosen meetup spot** with the group.
